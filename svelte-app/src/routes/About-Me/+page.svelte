    <p>Hi! My name is Kacie Franklin.
       I'm currently a student at South East Technological College, Carlow, in Ireland.
       The course I'm studying is Interactive Digital Art in Media and Design,
       a course that focuses on digital art and website design and programming.
       Art is a huge passion of mine always has been and I only aim to improve as time goes by.
       A lot of my art is original characters I made and hold fondly to my heart which I plan to eventually tell their stories in one way or another.
       During my primary and secondry school years I learned to speak Irish and can speak it fluently.
       I don't know what else to say about myself so I'll leave it here for now.
    </p>

    <p>Thank you for stopping by my website and having a look, hope you have a good day!</p>
